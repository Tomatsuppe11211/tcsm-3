            <p>
                Come join us at the Community Science Museum where we’re committed 
                to making science accessible to all.
            </p>

            <p>
                Over the course of human history, science has developed from our 
                early understanding of fire, wind, water, and earth to exploring 
                everything from galaxies far away to the very building blocks of 
                life itself.
            </p>

            <p>
                The aim of our museum is to create a space where everyone can experience 
                the wonders of our discoveries and perhaps even ignite a lifelong passion 
                to continue the exploration of the world around us.

                <p>
                    On loan from the NEMO Science Museum in Amsterdam, the Energetica 
                    exhibition is coming to the Community Science Museum. It’s a series 
                    of installations that allow visitors to experience the power of 
                    the elements as we harness them. From solar energy powering lighting, 
                    to ‘Wind Island’ that shows how turbines are able to use and control
                     wind to create power.
