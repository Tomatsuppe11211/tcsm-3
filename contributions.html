            <p>
                A number of people volunteer their time and effort to keep the displays in 
                good order and ready for visitors to come and enjoy. Volunteering has its 
                perks including getting to see behind the scenes of a working museum, 
                access to staff-only lectures, and a monthly lunch where all staff and 
                volunteers come together to discuss ideas for future exhibits and strategies 
                for the museum.
            </p>

            <p>
                You can help volunteer in a number of different spheres. Please contact us if 
                you’d like to find out more about how you can get involved.

                There are various ways you can support the museum. Donations are very 
                welcome and are an important way we keep this museum open and accessible 
                to the whole community.
            </p>

            <p>
                You can also support us by donating items of interest to the museum’s 
                collections. If you have some item or collection that you think others 
                would enjoy, please let us know by contacting our Collections Department 
                and they will be able to assist you.
