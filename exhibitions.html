            <h1>Exhibitions</h1>

            <p>
                We believe science should not be confined to the textbook, but brought to live 
                through exhibits. This is why we have over 1000 different exhibits on the many 
                varied subjects of science to explore. Many of these exhibits are designed for 
                you to interact with and play around to see science come to life (apart from 
                the dinosaur exhibits – they only come to life at night when everyone’s gone home).

            <h2>Evolution</h2>

            <p>
                For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with the question of our 
                origins. Where do we come from and how did we get here? Since Darwin proposed his 
                theory of evolution we have had a framework for exploring and understanding our 
                place in this world.
            </p>

            <p>
                Discover the origins of life on this planet and how the species we know today have 
                evolved our time. You can also take some time to meet a few of the creatures who 
                didn’t survive, including our Woolly Mammoth, the Dodos, and a number of dinosaurs too.

            <h2>Biology and Medicine</h2>

            <p>
                From micro-organisms to the human body, major breakthroughs in biology are offering 
                us unique insights into the great wonders of the tiny world.
            </p>

            <p>
                For many people their life expectancy is much longer and their quality of life much 
                improved, thanks to the growth of our understanding of medicine. Over a series of 
                exhibits we explore the history of medicine and take a look at some major breakthroughs 
                including the discovery of penicillin and the first heart transplant.
            </p>

            <p>
                Many of our great medicinal discoveries have come not only from the lab, but also from 
                observing animals in the wild. Often our fellow creatures have beat us to it.

            <h2>Cosmology</h2>

            <p>
                Explore the wonders of our cosmos. Our fantastic exhibition, ‘The Sky Above Us’, explores 
                the night sky and what we can see and know about the universe around us. We’ll locate the 
                various constellations and galaxies that can be seen and learn a bit about the early 
                navigators who used the stars to travel by.
            </p>

            <p>
                Follow the journey of our solar exploration: from early Arab traders, to Galileo’s telescope, 
                to the latest exploration of the planets in our solar system.

            <h2>Robotics and AI</h2>

            <p>
                The information revolution is here and robotics and artificial intelligence are the science of 
                the future. From useful home applications of AI to industrial uses of robotics, the future is 
                here. You can even say hello and shake the hand of Rob the Robot.

            <h2>Ecology</h2>
            
            <p>
                As we learn more and more of the impact humans are having on the planet, the more important it becomes 
                that scientists explore how to create a sustainable future not just for humans but for the whole planet.
            </p>

            <p>
                In our ecology section of the museum, we unpack the dangers we currently face including global warming, 
                extinction of species, and pollution. But we also focus on the positive ways we can all contribute to a 
                brighter future.
